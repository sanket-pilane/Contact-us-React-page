# React Contact Page 

This is my second React project, which I have been working on for a week as a part of my React development learning journey. The project focuses on creating a single-page contact page using React. During the development of this project, I have learned several key concepts and techniques, which I will outline below.


## Project Overview

## What I've Learned

### 1. Creating Separate Modules

I've learned how to break down my React application into separate modules to organize my code efficiently. This approach enhances code reusability and maintainability.

### 2. Using CSS for Individual Modules

I've gained experience in styling individual React modules using CSS. This allows for a more modular and organized approach to styling components within the application.

### 3. Using `useState`

I've learned how to use the `useState` hook in React to manage and update component state. This hook is essential for handling dynamic data and user interactions.

### 4. Installing Packages via Command Line

I've become familiar with the process of installing external packages and dependencies using command-line tools, such as npm or yarn. This is crucial for adding functionality to my React project.

### 5. Handling Events in React

I've learned how to handle user events, such as clicks and input changes, in React components. This enables me to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.

### 6. Implementing React Icons

I've gained the skills to integrate and use React Icons in my project. This allows me to easily include a wide variety of icons to enhance the user experience.

## Project Workflow

1. **Figma Design**: I began the project by creating a design for the contact page using Figma. This design served as a blueprint for the project's layout and styling.

2. **Coding**: With the design in hand, I started coding the React project, breaking it down into separate modules and applying CSS for styling. I used the `useState` hook to manage component state and incorporated event handling to make the page interactive.

## Project Setup

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanket-pilane/Contact-us-React-page.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-contact-page
   ```
3. Install project dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start dev
    ```

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following main dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Library for adding icons to React applications.

Please refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of dependencies.

## Conclusion

This React Contact Page project has been an excellent learning experience, allowing me to apply various React concepts and techniques. I've gained valuable knowledge about creating separate modules, styling components using CSS, managing state with `useState`, installing packages via the command line, handling events in React, and implementing React Icons.

I started the project by creating a design for the contact page using Figma, which served as a blueprint for the project's layout and styling. With the design in hand, I broke down the project into separate modules, applied CSS for styling, and used the `useState` hook to manage component state. I also implemented event handling to make the page interactive.

Feel free to explore the code and project structure to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
